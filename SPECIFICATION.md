# ✅ **SPECIFICATION.md — Final Prototype #1**

### *ArtGrow – PKMS + Task Manager + AI Assistant*

---

## **1. Overview**

ArtGrow is a **terminal-based Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS)** designed specifically for **artists who want to grow consistently**, store drawing knowledge, manage study tasks, and receive AI-powered feedback or practice plans.

This software integrates:

1. **PKMS (Notes System)**
2. **Task Management System**
3. **Chat-style CLI interface**
4. **AI Agents (using OpenAI)**
5. **JSON-based storage**
6. **Portable Python package (Windows, macOS, Linux)**

This specification describes the **blueprint** of the system — not code, not tests — but the **intended behavior, structure, and features** of the final version.

---

## **2. Goals of the System**

* Help artists keep notes about anatomy, gesture, shading, composition, etc.
* Allow creating categorized tasks like “gesture practice,” “finish composition study,” etc.
* Provide searchability for both notes and tasks.
* Act as a personal study assistant with AI-generated:

  * note summaries
  * practice routines
* Run entirely in a terminal interface
* Store data locally in human-readable JSON

---

## **3. System Architecture**

The project is organized into the following Python modules:

### **1️⃣ final/models.py**

Defines core data structures:

* `Note`
* `Task`

Each is a dataclass with methods:

* `create(...)`
* `to_dict()`
* `from_dict(...)`

### **2️⃣ final/storage.py**

Handles all persistent JSON storage:

* `notes.json`
* `tasks.json`
* directory creation
* reading/writing JSON
* generating next IDs

### **3️⃣ final/pkms.py**

Implements the **Note** (PKMS) features:

* add-note
* list-notes
* view-note
* search-notes

### **4️⃣ final/task_manager.py**

Implements the **Task System**:

* add-task
* list-tasks
* complete-task
* delete-task
* search-tasks

### **5️⃣ final/ai_agents.py**

Implements two AI helpers:

* Summarize a note into an **art improvement tip**
* Suggest **daily practice routines** based on user struggles + notes + tasks

### **6️⃣ final/main.py**

Implements a **chat-style CLI** with a command loop:

* interprets commands
* routes to correct modules
* prints output

  * title
  * multiline content
  * comma-separated tags
* View individual notes
* List all notes
* Search by:

  * title
  * content
  * tags
* Notes are stored in `notes.json`

---

### **B. Task Manager**

* Create tasks with:

  * title
  * description
  * priority
  * category (optional)

* Tasks stored in `tasks.json`

---

### **C. AI Agents**

#### **1. ai-summarize-note <id>**

→ Summarizes a note as an **actionable art tip**
e.g., “Simplify the ribcage into two ellipses…”

#### **2. ai-suggest-practice**

→ Generates a **personalized practice routine**
based on:

* user's struggles
* recent notes
* recent tasks

---

## **6. Storage Specifications**

All storage uses **plain JSON**, human-readable.

Example notes.json:

```json
{
  "notes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Shoulder Anatomy",
      "content": "...",
      "tags": ["anatomy", "gesture"],

## **7. Constraints & Requirements**

* Must run with Python 3.9+
* Must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux
* No external database (JSON only)
* No GUI (terminal only)
* Code must be modular and readable
* AI features must check API key

---

## **8. Out-of-Scope (for Prototype #1)**

These **are not included yet** but could be future commits:

❌ folder/subfolder structure
❌ multimedia embedding
❌ syncing across devices
❌ GUI
❌ cloud storage

Those are possible improvements for **Prototype #2**.

Here are the **complete, clean, professor-ready features** of **Final Prototype #1** of your project *ArtGrow – PKMS + Task Manager + AI Assistant*.

This list is **exactly what you should put in SPECIFICATION.md (Prototype #1 section), DOCUMENTATION.md introduction, and SUMMARY.md**.

You can:

1. Add a note
2. Add a task
3. Search them
4. View them
5. Get AI suggestions
