# CSC299 Project Timeline

# Milestones:

1. **2025-09-22**:

Try Notion and Obsidian

Create your public GitHub repo named csc299-project

Discuss this project with your favorite LLM:
-ask for ideas
-Ask for a study plan for concepts to learn
-ask for prototypes
-Save those conversations in your GitHub repo

2. **2025-10-08**: ensure that you have tried out the diff, patch, and git experiments performed in teaching plans and lectures
(it is critical to become comfortable with git before we develop larger examples)

5. **2025-10-13**: ensure that your public GitHub repo named csc299-project is shared with GitHub user bcdroid
use exactly the name csc299-project (no variations with capitalization; rename your repository on GitHub if necessary)

7. **2025-10-20**:
-create a prototype command-line application that allows storing, listing, and searching tasks stored in a JSON data file
-put the code into files underneath a directory tasks1 in your csc299-project repository
-add a README.md file with instructions for running your code inside the tasks1 directory
-so your csc299-project repository should have a tasks1 directory, and Python file(s) plus a README.md file inside that tasks1 directory
-make sure that your commits are in your public GitHub repo (not just your local repository)
