- Create a **prototype command-line application** that:

  - Keeps all code in a folder named `tasks1` inside your repo.
  - Includes a `README.md` in the `tasks1` folder with instructions for running the app.
- Make sure all commits are **pushed to your public GitHub repo** (not just saved locally).
