# Final Project Prototype #1

ArtGrow – PKMS + Task Manager + AI Assistant
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

ArtGrow is a terminal-based Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS) designed 
specifically for artists who want to grow consistently, store drawing knowledge, 
manage study tasks, and receive AI-powered feedback or practice plans.

This software integrates:

PKMS (Notes System)

Task Management System

Chat-style CLI interface

AI Agents (using OpenAI)

JSON-based storage

Portable Python package (Windows, macOS, Linux)

This specification describes the blueprint of the system — not code, not tests — but the intended behavior, structure, and features of the final version.

2. Goals of the System

Help artists keep notes about anatomy, gesture, shading, composition, etc.

Allow creating categorized tasks like “gesture practice,” “finish composition study,” etc.

Provide searchability for both notes and tasks.

Act as a personal study assistant with AI-generated:

note summaries

practice routines

Run entirely in a terminal interface

Store data locally in human-readable JSON

3. System Architecture

The project is organized into the following Python modules:

1️⃣ final/models.py

Defines core data structures:

Note

Task

Each is a dataclass with methods:

create(...)

to_dict()

from_dict(...)

2️⃣ final/storage.py

Handles all persistent JSON storage:

notes.json

tasks.json

directory creation

reading/writing JSON

generating next IDs

3️⃣ final/pkms.py

Implements the Note (PKMS) features:

add-note

list-notes

view-note

search-notes

4️⃣ final/task_manager.py

Implements the Task System:

add-task

list-tasks

complete-task

delete-task

search-tasks

5️⃣ final/ai_agents.py

Implements two AI helpers:

Summarize a note into an art improvement tip

Suggest daily practice routines based on user struggles + notes + tasks

6️⃣ final/main.py

Implements a chat-style CLI with a command loop:

interprets commands

routes to correct modules

prints output

4. Data Model Specification
Note Model
Field	Type	Description
id	int	unique ID
title	str	short note title
content	str	full text
tags	list[str]	art-specific tags like “anatomy”, “gesture”
created_at	str	ISO timestamp
updated_at	str	ISO timestamp
Task Model
Field	Type	Description
id	int	unique ID
title	str	short task name
description	str	details of the task
priority	str	low / medium / high
status	str	todo / in-progress / done
category	str?	e.g., gesture, projects, study
due_date	str?	optional
created_at	str	ISO timestamp
completed_at	str?	timestamp when done
5. Core Features
A. Notes (PKMS)

Create notes with:

title

multiline content

comma-separated tags

View individual notes

List all notes

Search by:

title

content

tags

Notes are stored in notes.json

B. Task Manager

Create tasks with:

title

description

priority

category (optional)

due date (optional)

List tasks with optional filtering (todo/done/in-progress)

Mark tasks done

Delete tasks

Search tasks

Tasks stored in tasks.json

C. AI Agents
1. ai-summarize-note <id>

→ Summarizes a note as an actionable art tip
e.g., “Simplify the ribcage into two ellipses…”

2. ai-suggest-practice

→ Generates a personalized practice routine
based on:

user's struggles

recent notes

recent tasks

D. CLI Interface

Runs in terminal using:

python -m final.main


Command examples:

add-note
list-notes
view-note 2
search-notes gesture
add-task
list-tasks todo
complete-task 3
delete-task 3
ai-summarize-note 1
ai-suggest-practice
help
exit

6. Storage Specifications

All storage uses plain JSON, human-readable.

Example notes.json:

{
  "notes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Shoulder Anatomy",
      "content": "...",
      "tags": ["anatomy", "gesture"],
      "created_at": "...",
      "updated_at": "..."
    }
  ]
}

7. Constraints & Requirements

Must run with Python 3.9+

Must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux

No external database (JSON only)

No GUI (terminal only)

Code must be modular and readable

AI features must check the API key

8. Out-of-Scope (for Prototype #1)

These are not included yet, but could be future commits:

❌ folder/subfolder structure
❌ multimedia embedding
❌ syncing across devices
❌ GUI
❌ cloud storage

Those are possible improvements for Prototype #2.
