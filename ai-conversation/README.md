# AI Conversation records:

This folder contains saved conversations with ChatGPT that document the thought process, discussions, and guidance received during the development of the CSC 299 project. 

# Purpose:

The goal of these files is to show how ideas were explored, clarified, refined, and improved through AI-assisted discussions before and during implementation.

# Files summary:

- **ChatGPT1**: Initial project conversation with ChatGPT to ask about ideas, study plan for concepts to learn, and prototypes for our CSC 299 final project
that revolves around the use of AI-coding assistants to plan, specify, develop, and test your own software that includes a personal knowledge management system (PKMS),
personal task management system, a terminal-based chat interface to interact with your stored knowledge and tasks, and AI agents that interact with your stored
knowledge or tasks, all written in Python, and must be able to run reliably on Windows, OSX, and Linux. The state must be stored in JSON documents, a SQLite database,
or a Neo4j database.

# Important takeaways:

- **ChatGPT1**: These conversations helped me understand each component that the project requires and what its features are, explained through clear and simple examples.
They also guided me in shaping my idea — creating Artify, a personal assistant designed for people who want to improve their drawing by allowing them to track their art goals,
store learning notes, and receive AI-based suggestions to enhance their skills. Furthermore, I came to understand the true importance of Git. What I once thought was just a simple
command prompt, I learned actually plays a much larger role — helping me track my coding progress, prototypes, and commits throughout the project.
Overall, these conversations helped me connect and clarify every aspect of the project, leaving no trace of confusion.

## Notes
These files serve as a record of AI collaboration and planning, not executable code. They complement the main project files in the `tasks1` directory.
